# nodetestrunner README

The Initial idea is to create something that will make it easier to see the changes youve made to a node project.

Instead of; 
_save_, _ctrl+c_ in terminal, _type node ._, then inspect changes

I would like it to be
_save_, then inspect changes 

## Features

This will restart your node server on any changes created in the file if the node server was running to begin with

## Requirements

For the time being I only plan for this to work with linux.

Once linux is up and running I will think about working on windows.

## Extension Settings

None now, but I would like to provide options for when you want your server to run.

For example:

If you change a particular file.
